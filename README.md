# stoics-overlay
the stoic gentoo overlay

This overlay contains ebuilds that I personally maintain or copied from other overlays with minor changes.

### How to use this overlay?
Since I don't have the overlay listed under the [gentoo overlays](https://repos.gentoo.org/), you have to manually add it in your repos.conf.

### Credits for certain ebuilds.
bolt-launcher-0.10.0.ebuild - [solarbaron-overlay](https://github.com/solarbaron/solarbaron-overlay/tree/5a66c75edc21ebf77e83f3d3fad57cb7816a8e99/games-rpg/bolt-launcher)
